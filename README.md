# machine-status-tracker

A web app with 
main page - card display of "machines" and their status.
Status are - operational, second factor needed, non operational. 
When pressed each card would lead to the page of that "machine" where depending on the status the user could interact with that machine, if status is closed- user can fill a checklist for opening the machine. If status is second factor needed, the user will be able to fill a checklist for a second factor to the opening process. If status is operational the user will be able to see an 08 hours timer counting down from when the machine went through a successful process of opening by first and second factor, which will be viewed by an avatar picture and name to identify who opened the machine
